				<p>If you have had a look at the documentation you&#8217;ve probably noticed a few elements like &#8220;ServiceInstall&#8221;, &#8220;User&#8221; and &#8220;WebVirtualDir&#8221;. What these elements all have in common is that if you add them to a wix document they will compile and link with out any problem, but they will not do anything at all on installation. If you take a closer at the msi produced using the reason they do nothing becomes clear, for example the User elements generates a table called user in the Msi and if you read the windows installer documentation you will quickly see there is no User table defined.  … </p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve always been interested in the inner workings of ASP.NET, and with ASP.NET 2.0 coming out along with a new version of F# I decided I&#8217;d have a better stab at creating some kind of support of ASP.NET in F#. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &ldquo;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&rdquo; /&gt;&nbsp;/o:p To create a page the framework compiles the aspx source into a .NET type that derives from System.Web.UI.Page.

				<p>Rob Mensching has been promising to put an updated version of WiX with better written documentation on sourceforget.net for a while now. But at the time of writing the May 27th build is still the latest one. But do you know what? I&#8217;m beginning not to care. I&#8217;m actually getting to the point where I can do anything I want: though the gifts of dark and orca (for examining what&#8217;s going on in an msi) and virtual pc for an easy way to test roll outs.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>I needed to add a CustomAction that removed the native image from the GAC. To do this I came across more slightly odd behaviour from the windows install platform so I thought I&#8217;d write a blog entry about it. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &ldquo;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&rdquo; /&gt;&nbsp;/o:p At first glance creating an uninstall action looks dead easy. Just create a custom action that does the opposite of what you did on install.  … </p>

				<p>&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &ldquo;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&rdquo; /&gt; As I alluded to in my last wix blog entry if you want to provide any sort of location robust access to well known folders Type 50 CustomActions are not for you. I thought I could get away with this as we&#8217;re just using msi to deploy our bespoke app to the testing environments which we control. However my boss came to me this morning saying they had one machine on behaving in a pre-jited manor could I take a look; sure enough the windows folder on this machine was c:\winnt rather than c:\windows like I had assumed it would be.  … </p>

				<p>I recently had to create an msi installer that ran ngen on each of the assemblies that I installed. I had a number of difficulties doing this, so I thought I share my findings here an hopefully save others a bit of time. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &ldquo;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&rdquo; /&gt;&nbsp;/o:p I won&#8217;t have been able to do this at all with out orca, an MSI decompiler supplied with the installer section of the platform SDK.  … </p>
