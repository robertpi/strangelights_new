			<div class="post-content">
				<p>[Update 05-09_2007: minor change to both source and binary release to fix F# interactive intergration, if you download a version before this date please redownload]
Recently I’ve been working on integrating F# into #Develop. It’s a nice, well designed and developed platform, and despite one or two glitches integration has gone pretty quick. My aim is to get the F# made part of the #Develop distribution, but, rightly so, there are a couple of legal and quality hurdles that need to be reached before it can be integrated into their main release.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>In part one we build a couple of simple frameworks that allow the programmer to specify that a value should be cached until one of its dependencies changed. I wanted to put these frameworks though their paces in a semi realistic environment. 
I decided to use the idea of pricing european options, since it’s similar to what we do at LexiFi, rather that work we the LexiFi pricer I took the simplest pricer I could find written in OCaml and adapted it to F# (this was hardly any work at all).  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>I recently started working on the F# integration with #Develop. #Develop is a free and open source IDE base that in many respects is very similar to Visual Studio. I actually found getting the basic integration going fairly easy, I have something that allows you to edit text files and build them. But as there’s not yet any colouring or auto-completion there no signification advantage over using that to any other text editor, so I’m not going to release it just yet, but watch this space.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>I had an interesting exchange of emails with a reader recently. They wanted to be able to execute a function and cache the result and revaluate the function only when one of the values in depends on changes. It’s a common enough problem I guess, but one that’s surprisingly tricky to get right. This is because when you evaluate a function it’s difficult to know what it depends on and therefore difficult to know when the results of the evaluation become dirty.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>When I was doing my A-levels way back in 1997 I often used to stay up late to listen to the Mark Radcliff Show in its grave yard shift phase on Radio 1. One catch phrase that does seem to be completely covered in the catch phrase guide is a “Another Quality Radio Item” although in later versions of the show this was shorten to “Quality Item” and used to refer to any feature on the show, I believe its origins came from when Mark and Lard would invite some guest on the show and they would proceed to have conversion about something very visual, realising the listener had no frame of reference they would stop themselves and say “Another Quality Radio Item” and then often carry on talking whatever they were talking about.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>When I saw that IronRuby had been released I thought I’d put it through its paces seeing how the language preformed with respect to IronPython and of course F#. Perhaps a little unfair for a number of reasons, firstly this is a pre-alpha release so one can’t really expect much, we need to give it time to mature and two, ruby generally performs slow than python in the “Computer Language Bench Mark Game”, (http://shootout.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>“Comparisons are odious” as my Mum used to say, but I hope this little comparison doesn’t pong too much. I have a range a little competitions of my own, a language bench mark, based on “The Computer Language Benchmarks Game” (http://shootout.alioth.debian.org), between IronPython and F#, with measurements for C# thrown in as a kind of control group. I would have liked to chuck in the new IronRuby language too, but I had problems finding a current release.  … </p>
