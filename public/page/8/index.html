			<div class="post-content">
				<p>A few people have noticed that a new book “Beginning F#” by me is available for pre-order on Amazon. I wanted to make it clear that this is the new title for the second edition of “Foundations of F#”. The publisher wanted the title change to make it clear that this was a complementary rather title to “Expert F#” rather than competing with it. It also reflects that during the rewrite that I’m focusing a lot on making the book more accessible to people with no functional programming experience.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>It’s fairly well know that Sequences or “seq”, the short hand for IEnumerable, are lazy. This has some interesting performance consequence I had not considered until recently. When we execute a line like:
letlotsOfInts = Seq.map (fun x -&gt; x + 1) (seq { 1 .. 1000000 })
The command executes almost instantaneously, despite the fact we’re creating a list of a million integers (Real: 00:00:00.001, CPU: 00:00:00.000 on my PC).  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>I note on in a previous blog post that I’ve started creating an open source project for manipulating data. For the moment it’s mainly based around the idea of “Collective Intelligence”, but I hope to draw on influences from other sources as it evolves. I’ve reorganised the source so it’s a bit clearer and added some other concepts, notably a tool for accessing books from “Project Guttenberg” and the work I did on generic algorithms.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>I’ve been interested in collective intelligence and machine learning for a while now. These too related fields centre round using statistical tools on large sets of data to make measurements and predictions. So when the UK’s Guardian newspaper announced their “Data-store”, a collection of data set open to the public I felt it was time to apply some of what I’ve learned to the data they were offer.
I choose to apply hierarchal clustering to the data on world health.  … </p>

I decided a little while ago that I’d like to change direction in my career and go back to consulting, after interviewing around a bit I decided to join ALTi. It was my first day on Monday, and so far I’m enjoying my first week, although obviously I’m just getting settled in.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>I’m very pleased to announce I’ve started working on a second edition of Foundations of F#. The aim is to document the language in the form it will be in when it is released in with Visual Studio 2010. This will be a challenge since it’s not yet known exactly what features will be in the final release.
So, why a second edition? It’s true that the original book is only about 2 years old, but that’s quite a long time in the IT industry these days and much has change in the F# landscape since the original was wrote and indeed much in the .  … </p>

				<p>No. 1 the Foreach Loop
Last weekend I attended JB Evian’s code camp in the l’Ardeche département in the south of France, just to the north of the Provence region that forms the south east part of the French Mediterranean coast. (I was very interested in visiting this area since my wife and I became begin fans of Nigel Farrell’s “A Place in the France” and “A Place in the France – Indian Summer”when we first move to France, Nigel’s problems seem to dwarf any we had and helped put things in perspective).  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>The models at Paris’ prestigious art school “Beaux Arts” intend to strike today over the mayor of Paris&rsquo; decision to ban the tips that students pay to them. Traditionally at the end of the session, if the students liked the model because they sat still or because they inspired their imagination, they pay a small tip called “cornet”. The mayor of Paris has decided to bad this practice because it is paid directly to the model in cash and so not taxed and therefore “argent au noir”.  … </p>

The mono team is composed of about 35 core members on the Novell payroll, as well as volunteers from the community.  … </p>
