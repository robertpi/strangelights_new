				<p>I’m off to Seattle for the MVP summit very soon. I’ve arranged to meet with fellow F# fan’s Cameron Frederick and Richard Minerich at the Tap House Bar in Belleveue at 3:30pm on Sunday. Happy hour start at 3:30pm, so it should be lots of fun. The address of the bar is 550 106th Avenue NE, Bellevue, which is near the hotels for the Summit. So come and join the F#UN!  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>Recently I’ve doing a little work with Windows Phone 7. One aspect that interests me a lot is the integration of the Accelerometer. An accelerometer is a instrument that allows you to measure the forces acting on the telephone, including the force of gravity. This information will allow you to know what the orientation of the phone is and if the is moving or not. However there are a few challenges in interpreting is information.  … </p>

				<p>So, the good folks at Skills Matter and I have been working hard to bring you the next edition of “Functional Programming eXchange” the program is just about in place now. The current program can be found here and we expect to be adding more names and some more details over the next weeks or so. Book now, or before December 31st and you can still get to see it all for the bargain price of £75.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>I’ve been doing a bit of work with Solver Foundation lately and as I got to know the package it suddenly occurred to me Solver Foundation could be easily used to solve Sudoku puzzles. While I knew that solving Sudoku in F# wasn’t particularly an original idea, Jon Harrop has a custom Sudoku solver in F# that dates back to 2007, but I thought using Solver Foundation might be an interesting approach.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>The MVVM (Model View View Model) design pattern is a popular way to create WFP (or Silverlight or Windows Phone 7) applications.Despite the obscure name, the design pattern is surprisingly simple. Basically, the programmer creates a view model which is bound the the view (i.e. the xaml) via WFP binding model. Thanks the WPF’s two way bindings, the INotifyPropertyChanged interface and the ObservableCollection&lt;T&gt; there’s very little need for any other direct interactions between the view and the bound model.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>I watched with interested Don’s talk at PDC. This blog post is to help me put in perspective some of my initial thoughts on what type providers are, I’ve tried to write it so you don’t need to see the video of the session first, but obviously it will help if you have. Some of this is just my speculation – I have no insider information so I can speculate, but don’t take everything I say too seriously.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>I find conversations in twitter hard to follow. For a start they’re backwards, the first thing you see is the last item in the conversation. Add to that the fact there very sporadic, it’s difficult to see which tweets users are reacting to, and it doesn’t make for a great conversation experience. I put together TwitMemento with the aim of fixing that. Firstly, it changes the order you see tweets in, instead of new ones being inserted at the top, they're inserted at the bottom, like a normal chat client or message board.  … </p>

				<p>Last week Skills Matter quietly announced that they will be hosting a new edition of the Functional Programming eXchange on 18th March 2011 at there head quarters in Holburn, London: http://skillsmatter.com/event/open-source-dot-net/functionalpx-2011
This new edition will have a similar theme to last years a event. It will be in depth talks on functional programming, some on the general theory of functional programming, some language specific talks (from a range of languages such as F#, Scala, Clojure, Haskell, OCaml) as well as case studies from people already using FP in industry.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>The role of a type system is to prove some property of you program is correct. The role of module system is dived your program into manageable/understandable chunks. An OO class confuses these too roles. </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>People often ask me what functional programming is all about and why is it useful. In an attempt to answer this question in a way that is relevant to object oriented programmers it struck me it might be useful to look at what people find useful in modern object oriented programming. Once we know what programmers like about OOP, specifically what problems it helps them solve that structured programming didn’t, we can look again at FP and look at how it approaches these problems.  … </p>
