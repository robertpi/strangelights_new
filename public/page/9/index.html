				<p>To coincide with the release the CTP release of F# Microsoft also released and early version “Solver Foundation”. Don Box described himself as being elated by its release. You can tell it’s an early version as it’s currently the only way to get it is part of “F# Optimization Modelling Language” sample on the MSDN code gallery.
So what does optimization mean in this context? Simply put an optimization problem is the problem of finding the best solution from all feasible solutions.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>F# is on dotnetrocks again, this time it’s Amanda Laucher and Ted Neward’s turn to talk F# with Carl and Richard. I have to say of all the F# podcast there have been so far this is my favourite. Why? Amanda and Ted do a really great job of articulating what I’ve been thinking about F#, and functional programming in general, for some time now. I think this is because Amanda and Ted have a similar background to me – they both come from the world of line of business applications.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>As mentioned in my previous post, I’ve been reading “Collective Intelligence” by Toby Segaram and I’m really enjoying in it. It’s different to a lot of programming books, in that rather than focusing a specific language or API it focus on a particular set of problems and shows techniques that can be used to crack them.
For example I’ve known for a long time that it’s easy to create an abstract syntax tree (AST) in F#:  … </p>

				<p>Well the F# T-shirt I ordered arrived last Thursday, meaning it took about a week or so after ordering:

If you want to see me in it then you’ll have to wait for pictures of alt.net London (yes I know you probably can control yourself for that long). </p>

				<p>Now that the F# CTP is out, you may be wondering what I think of it. Well I’m planning to tell you in a later post, first let me explain what I’ve been up to: If you’re a follower of this blog you’ve probably noticed that there hasn’t been a lot of activity lately (apart from the short announcement about JAOO.dk). This is largely due to the fact I’ve moved house and have been doing a lot of gardening and DIY lately.  … </p>

				<p>As mentioned previously I’ll be attending a couple of conferences soon and mainly inspired by Amanda Launcher’s F#TW t-shirt I decided to print up an F# t-shirt of my own. I had more ideas for designs that I could actually fit in my t-shirt draw, so I decided to make up a few designs and see if anyone else would like to buy them, you can see all the designs here.  … </p>

				<p>The first half of this series the accent is on immutable programming, because in the first part of the series we had an introduction to immutable data, and in this second part we’re going to look in depth at immutable programming possibilities, with the idea of show that this is actually not too different to what your used. Once we’ve conquered the immutability we’ll start to dig into the concurrency.  … </p>
