			<div class="post-content">
				<p>As I’ve mentioned before I’m very happy that I’ve been invited to speak at Stack Overflow’s Dev days. Since I first mentioned it the schedule has really been filled and is looking very good. I’m really looking forward to seeing the talks by Julian Browne and Andrew Pattinson on “NoSQL in the Enterprise” (as you might have guessed after yesterday’s post), Mark Levy on “Algorithms on Hadoop” and Michael Barker on “Performance &amp; Technology Folklore”.  … </p>

				<p>Today’s world is a confusing place. There are literally 1000 of choices available to us, in almost every domain. To take a mundane example there must be about 40 or 50 places to get lunch within easy walking distance of where I work, one could waste a lot of mental energy weighing up the merits or each restaurant and sandwich bar or you could do as I do and eat at the same place most days.  … </p>

				<p>Just a quick note to say the guys at IntelliFactory have created a great little site called “FPish” dedicated to Functional Programming training material and course. My profile can be found here.
The sites is completely written in F# using there WebSharper development tools, it’s a great example of the sort of very dynamic websites you can create with WebSharper. </p>

				<p>Way back in 2005 Nguyen Van Thien and Dinh Thi Thuy Nga, two computer science students from Vietnam, got in contact asking me to help them share the “Chinese Chess” computer game they’d written in F#. The game plays well and has nice graphics and sounds, quite an achievement given that F# was still in its infancy back in those days. Naturally I want to help them so I gave it a place on my website.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>I’ve been neglecting strangelights.com a bit lately, mainly due to lack of time. So, today I finally got round to fixing a few things that had been bugging me and clean away some of the old and out of data material, especially in the F# resources section. I’ve also upgraded to the latest version of subtext as a few people have reports some minor bugs with the comments system to me, so hopefully this will fix them.  … </p>

				<p>November is going to be a very busy month for me as I’m very happy to announce I’ll be speaking at Stack Overflow Dev Days at London’s ExCeL conference center on the 14th-15th November and the Progressive F# Tutorials at the Skills Matter eXchange on 3rd-4th November.
Both events have a great line up of speakers (who wouldn’t be excited to speak on the same program as the legendary Jon Skeet?  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>Lately I’ve been taking a look at how you might write web apps with F# using various existing frameworks. Often these frameworks don’t quite work the way you want them to and have small but annoying nuances when using them from F#. These projects are: PicoMvc – a minimalist MVC like framework. The basic aim of PicoMvc is to make it really easy to map an incoming URL to an F# controller function and then choose a view engine to render the result of this function.  … </p>

				<p>So Silverlight and .NET are dead. The Windows 8 team say so. Sounds familiar, we heard the same thing after PDC 2010? I’m not worried, here’s why. 1) If you haven’t already done so you may wan to stop by and read “The Tragic Death of Practically Everything” for a look at the many things that have been declared dead but really weren’t.
2) Even Google admit you can’t do everything with Html5 and javascript, to quote Google from this nice piece from The Register:  … </p>

				<p>I guess I came to Scrum and the agile software movement a little late in the day, I got interested in Scrum after attending the 2008 JAOO conference (now the GOTO conference) in Aarhus and then hearing Ken Schwaber talking about Scrum and the “definition of done” on an episode of Hanselminutes (http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=137). I was particularly interested in visiting this year’s Scrum Days because Ken Schwaber was giving one of the keynotes.  … </p>
