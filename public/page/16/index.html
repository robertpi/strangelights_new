			<div class="post-content">
				<p>A couple of weeks ago Don Box made a post about dynamic evaluation in C#. Since a console and dynamic evaluation are popular feature request for F# I decided to have ago at implementing this in F#. The results can be found here. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &ldquo;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&rdquo; /&gt;&nbsp;/o:p At the moment it&#8217;s pretty limited, you can just evaluate an express and the result will get thrown away, only values that are not functions will be evaluated properly, there&#8217;s no error handling and the printing of the output types is a little limited.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>Don Box made another post on Continuations and Closures that made me realised I&#8217;d made a mistake in my last post. I had not used continuation; I merely used a closure that captured some mutable variables. Also F#/Caml does not have continuations in the same way Ruby does.&nbsp;F#&nbsp;does however have continuation style passing, also discussed in Mr. Box aforementioned post. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &ldquo;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&rdquo; /&gt;&nbsp;/o:p Anyway I thought I&#8217;d write a sort piece to show continuation style passing in action in F# , using my old favourite the Fibonacci series.  … </p>

				<p>The ever charismatic Mr. Box made a lovely post about continuations in C# 2.0: http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2005/04/17/7467.aspx &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &ldquo;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&rdquo; /&gt;&nbsp;/o:p Because I have used a simpler Fibonacci implementation in couple of places, I thought I&#8217;d port it to F#. &nbsp;/o:p Of course continuations are not a new idea; they have been used for a long time in ML style programming. The implementation is most like the continuations by anonymous methods, as anonymous methods work well in ML as they are very similar idea to lambdas.  … </p>

				<p>I haven&#8217;t had a lot of time lately to update my FSharp site, as I&#8217;ve been very busy with at work. I thought it would be a neat idea if other people could update it too, so I have created the FSharpWiki. Have and look and remember YouAreEncouragedToChangeTheWiki. </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>People interested in the advantages for F# might do well to take a look at F# option type. This allows an F# programmer to specify the presents or absence of some data much the same way a C# programmer might use a null reference.  &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &ldquo;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&rdquo; /&gt;&nbsp;/o:p Let us take a quick look at how you might use the option type. It is implemented as a discriminating union so can be investigated with F#&#8217;s pattern matching constructs.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &ldquo;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&rdquo; /&gt;&nbsp;/o:p I think Tallow is a cool tool it can save you a lot of typing when creating a wix installation. I recently used it to create a couple of installations for a project I&#8217;m not. It was then I noticed it does have one downside: it does not add a Guid attribute to any of the Component tags it generates. &nbsp;/o:p I know this does sounds like a major thing, but it had me scratching my head of a while.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &ldquo;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&rdquo; /&gt;&nbsp;/o:p People have been known to ask me, what makes F# better than C#? This is a since what people think is good or bad about a programming languages just comes down to taste. However Alejandro Serrano blog post about how an F# typeof operator can be definedgot me thinking about things you can do in F# that you can in C#. In it he describes how you can define a typeof operator for F#, this is something you can not do it C# the type of function is build in to the compiler and can not be defined as a method.  … </p>

				<p>I came across this article via Slashdot, which seems to be an abridge of an article that I&#8217;d already seen via lambda the ultimate. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &ldquo;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&rdquo; /&gt;&nbsp;/o:p The idea of extensible programming languages is interesting one but not a particularly a new one and nor do I think xml is the right tool for solving these problems.  &nbsp;/o:p XML as a programming language &nbsp;/o:p XML is a good way of representing data, especially if the data needs to be passed between systems or serialised for storage.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>Don Syme recently made this post about adding IntelliSense to the visual studio intergration of F#. Although I do missing the &lt;ctrl&gt;-&lt;space&gt;, there are some nice features to the current version. In fact the back ground error checking is better that C# in both visual studio 2003 and 2005. The F# intergration will warn you if you are using an type that does not exists, C# will not do this.  … </p>
