			<div class="post-content">
				<p>Well we&rsquo;re doing it again!
 I&rsquo;ve been running a conference &ldquo;Functional Programming eXchange&rdquo; in London for a few years now. The conference is run by Skills Matter and will take place on Friday 15th Mar 2013.
 The idea of the conference is to bring together London&rsquo;s diverse functional programming communities to share ideas and war stories. Most previous talks have focus on concepts from functional programming or feedback from projects that have used functional programming.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>Visual Studio 2012 has been out for a while now, I’ve been using it every day at work and I’m generally very happy with it. The biggest win is the performance, which is some much better than VS2010.
 I’ve finally begun to get curious about the new stuff in VS2012. Visual Studio was delivered with .NET 4.5 a shiny new version of the .NET framework, that will allow developers to create “Metro” style apps (which for reason that are too silly to go into are no longer called Metro style apps, but we will continue to call them Metro style apps in this article as suitable name has yet to be found).  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>Things are changing at Microsoft (or maybe they changed a while ago and it took me all this time to notice). The short story is the company no longer cares whether you use their development tools, they only care that you target their platforms: Windows 8 and Windows Azure.
The result is this, Microsoft is in the process of opening up Software Development tool chain. They no longer see themselves as the owners of .  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>For Functional Programming eXchange 2012 and I’ve tried to put together a programming that mixes the best the functional programming community has to give. I wanted both talks that show how functional programming languages can be used more effectively and that show off new up and coming language and new language features. I also wanted talks that gave feedback from project that were implemented using functional languages. I’m pleased to say we have plenty of both.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>Recently I sent a bit of time playing with Overtone. I’ve always been interested in music, but have little talent when it comes to playing instruments, so I really like the idea of a DSL for creating music. I was also inspired by one of my Christmas presents The Wave Watchers Companion to explore relationship between waves and sound. A secondary aim of playing with overtone was to learn a bit more about Clojure which is definitely one of the most interesting languages about at the moment.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>Just a quick note to say that my talk “The Combinator Approach to Programming Domain Specific Languages with F#” is now available on Skills Matter site. I’ve put the code on github.
If you enjoyed the talk I’ll be giving it again at CodeKen, the conference formally know as Stackoverflow Dev Days, on 14th/15th November.
Combinators are a really nice, and under appreciated, way to create DSLs and we go into them in depth on my Beginning F# course at Skills Matter.  … </p>

				<p>Ever since it was announced that Dart would be announced at GOTO conference I’ve been wonder what dart would be like. I thought I’d take the time put down my initial thoughts here.
Is there a need for another language?
Tim Anderson poses the question nicely here, so I thought I’d have a stab at answering it. There are a lot of programming languages in the world, so there would seem to be limited space for a new one.  … </p>

				<p>I have an idea for a type provider, so now that the type provider bits are finally publicly available I set to work building it. However it turns out just implementing a type provider is pretty tricky (not really that much of a surprise I supose), so I thought it was worth a quick blog post to run through the basics.
A type provider is a class that implements the interface ITypeProvider (fullname Microsoft.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>I actually have the last two episodes of my RavenDB series ready to go, but doesn’t seem much point publishing them this week, so here’s a few thoughts on stuff from build and Windows 8 instead.
Firstly Windows 8: I thought the build keynotes did a nice job of selling Windows 8, although adjectives like super and amazing were used far too much for my tastes. I would like a Windows 8 tablet because it seems to do a nice job of bring it all together, yes it’s nothing you can’t get already from Apple (iPad, Mac Air, etc.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>We’ve decided to do it again. After the success of the Functional Programming eXchange 2011 and 2009, we have decided to put on another edition. Functional Programming eXchange 2012 will take place on Friday March 16th March 2012, at the Skills Matter eXchange, in London.
The program is under construction, I’ve already started to invite speakers whose work in the functional programming community interests and excites me. I’m actively seeking other speakers so if you’d be interested in following in the footsteps of previous speakers such as: Simon Peyton Jones, Miles Sabin, David Pollak, Adam Granicz, Antonio Cisternino, Tomas Petricek, Jonas Boner, and Viktor Klang, then send an email with a talk abstract to talks_functionalpx@skillsmatter.  … </p>
