				<p>As noted here and here I have created some documents for F# using NDoc and the xml files that are available on with the F# download. There still in &ldquo;beta&rdquo; phase as I&rsquo;ll be making refinements such as search engine optimisations, as well as a build in search, but you may already find them useful. Enjoy!&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &ldquo;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&rdquo; /&gt;/o:p </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>This is an explanation of why the var &#8220;keyword&#8221; is like it is, and how this effects anonymous classes. I should probably point out I&#8217;m nothing to do with the C# design team, so these are merely my own opinions.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &ldquo;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&rdquo; /&gt;/o:p &nbsp;/o:p The var is all about type inference, it&#8217;s important to remember this is still static typing. The var keyword informs the compiler that it should try and infer the type of variable; if it can not do this a compile error is generated.  … </p>

				<p>Last night we ate at the palace kitchen, why? Because Don Box recommended it to us! And very good it was too, we enjoyed a nice bottle of west coast red wine, which even my French friend Eric thought was good.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &ldquo;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&rdquo; /&gt;/o:p &nbsp;/o:p Anyway when our small party met him he was in the middle of a discussion with another Microsoft guy about xaml. They were talking about the possibility of using xaml to generate in memory only assemblies, of course while this is fun it does raise all sort of security issues, so Don suggest that you could send the xaml to an indigo service and sign with the propitiate ws-* feature.  … </p>

				<p>I recently started measuring what gets downloaded and this made me noticed that my AssemblyExplorer tool is still very popular. I found this a little strange as its hopeless out of date. Also, why&nbsp;wouldn&rsquo;t you just use reflector&nbsp;Anyway as it was popular I decided I&#8217;d revamp it, and sat down to do just that this morning. I successful completed the first stage of things, it now it works with the latest version of F# and AbsIl.  … </p>

				<p>If you take a look under the hood at the new System.Query name space you will see that the core of it is located in the &#8220;Sequence&#8221; class and this class bears an amazing resemblance to the F# List library located in the MLLib.dll. Okay you have to use your imagination a tiny bit, but if you consider that:&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &ldquo;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&rdquo; /&gt;/o:p &nbsp;/o:p System.Collections.Generic.IEnumberable&lt;T&gt;() /o:p &nbsp;/o:p Is really not that different from:/o:p &nbsp;/o:p Microsoft.  … </p>

It seems what you can do though the IDE is a bit limited, for example there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be away to map source control folder to a folder on the disk without using &lsquo;h&rsquo;./o:p &nbsp;/o:p The full details of the commands are available here:/o:p http://blogs.msdn.com/buckh/articles/CommandLineSummary.aspx/o:p &nbsp;/o:p And if you did want to map a folder the syntax would be:/o:p h workfold /map /workspace:MyWorkspaceName $/MySSPath C:\MyPath/o:p &nbsp;/o:p There are a couple of slightly annoying things:/o:p &nbsp;- There&#8217;s no way copy and past the path so you have type it out in manually/o:p &nbsp;- Once you&#8217;ve mapped the path you can&#8217;t just &#8220;check out&#8221; and start editing, you have to get latest version first.  … </p>

				<p>&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &ldquo;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&rdquo; /&gt; A couple of days ago Chris Sells made this post about the way&nbsp;best to parse command line augments. Given an xml document describing the structure of a command line augment, he wants to know would it be best to use code gen or an interpreter to parse command line arguments. Here is the xml structure he was talking about./o:p &nbsp;/o:p &lt;args description=&ldquo;Two wrongs don&rsquo;t make a right, but three lefts do&rdquo;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;arg name=&ldquo;lefts&rdquo; description=&ldquo;Number of left turns&rdquo; type=&ldquo;int&rdquo; default=4&rdquo; /&gt;&nbsp; &lt;arg name=&ldquo;attitude&rdquo; description=&ldquo;Driver attitude&rdquo; required=&ldquo;true&rdquo; type=&ldquo;string&rdquo; /&gt;&lt;/args&gt;/o:p &nbsp;/o:p F# (and the ML languages in general) offers a third way.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &ldquo;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&rdquo; /&gt; Last time we took a look at folding. It may not have escaped the readers notice that some operations are dependent on the order the parameters are processed. For instance in the string concatenation example the order the parameters are processed affects the order they appear in the output string. But in this example to reverse the order of result does not actually require access to the list in both directions, it is only necessary to reverse the order that the parameters are concatenated in:/o:p &nbsp;/o:p // intList = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}/o:p string result2 = /o:p Fold(/o:p delegate(int value1, string value2) { return value2 + &ldquo;, &rdquo; + value1; }, /o:p &rdquo;&ldquo;, /o:p intList);/o:p // result2 = &#8220;, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6&#8221;/o:p &nbsp;/o:p string result3 = /o:p Fold(/o:p delegate(int value1, string value2) { return value1 + &ldquo;, &rdquo; + value2; }, /o:p &rdquo;&ldquo;, /o:p intList);/o:p // result3 = &#8220;6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1,&#8221;/o:p &nbsp;/o:p However some operations such as division are trickier and process the list in different directions will give different results; we can just get away with process the parameters differently.  … </p>

				<p>Late there has been quite a lot of talk about functional programming in C#. Efforts by Don Box, have been note and used on this blog several times and now that and now Sriram Krishnan has produced this nice piece on currying in C# 2.0.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &ldquo;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&rdquo; /&gt;/o:p &nbsp;/o:pOne area that seams to have been over looked so far is folding. A folding function is similar to a mapping function and mapping functions are supported by the framework library in version 2.  … </p>
