				<p>I probably should have posted this a bit earlier but here goes anyway: I will be presenting at Microsoft TechDays Paris, my talk will be co-presented with Don Syme and we'll be talking about parallelism and F#. Don will also be presenting an introduction to F#. Don's talk is at 14:30 and our joint talk is at 17:30.

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>In part three of this series we looked at how message queues could be used to receive updates from multiple threads and ensure that a data structure remain consistent. Now I would like to look at how messages queue can be used to spread work between different queues to allow it to the work to be performed in parallel. We will also look at an alternative mechanism of doing this using semaphores.  … </p>

				<p>There’s a new place in town for you to geek out over F#, as well as the http://cs.hubfs.netnew there’s also a face book group: http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=5394519167&amp;ref=nf(Requires a facebook profile but seems everyone has one these days).

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>Why is the introduction of Erlang style message passing into F# interesting? Well you may have never heard of Erlang but if you’ve ever used a cell phone you’ve probably used an Erlang system. Erlang was originally built by Ericsson and released as open source in 1998, it was built to support the highly distributed and fault-tolerant systems required to support mobile phone networks. Many people consider Erlang to be the language that gets concurrency right.  … </p>

Great news, just posted something on it myself.
I guess you are also used to the comment I picked out? </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>As Don Syme points out in his piece on asynchronous workflows, they are not about getting the whole of concurrency right but rather about getting asynchronous I/O.I think that to fully appreciate the beauty of asynchronous workflows one must understand the ugliness of what it’s like to do asynchronous I/O without them. I think this may be true for many areas of software development,hell even good old C looks great if you’ve been forced to spend some time assembler, and I guess Joel and his law of “leaky abstractions” is saying something along a similar lines.  … </p>

				<p>Took advantage of the nice weather and went for a long cycle today, we came across quite a few chestnut trees and could help taking advantage of this free food. I think we got over 3 KG in the end

Saw plenty of people out mushrooming, would have liked to have gathered some of those too, but I don’t know enough about it so would have probably ended picking the poisonous ones.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>So I was going to start this series with an over of concurrency options on the .NET framework, but after playing F# asynchronous workflows, I decided to blog about them as they just too exciting to keep quiet about. Maybe I’ll spin back at the end of the series and do a summary of other options at the end of the series.
This post will look at how to use concurrent workflows; it will not look into the mechanics of workflows themselves, which are explained in this nice blog post from Don Syme.  … </p>

				<p>There will be two F# presentations at TechEd Europe this year, one by Don Syme on concurrent programming in F#. See the full abstract below for more details
Parallel and Asynchronous Functional Programming on .NET with F#
Functional programming a hot topic: there is a growing awareness of functional techniques in the developer community, and people are beginning to see that imperative OO programming has deep limitations in a networked and concurrent multi-core world.  … </p>
