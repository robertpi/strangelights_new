			<div class="post-content">
				<p>The first of this series covered our general aims how we’d be structuring the project. This post will cover how we get the data into RavenDB.
First we need to download the data. I got it obtained the data from this site, you need to click the “téléchanger la base” link under “Coordonnées géographiques des villes Françaises” here is the direct link. It’s not the best data source in the world, but it’s the best freely available one that I’ve found.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>So Stack Overflow Dev Days has been cancelled. Obviously it’s a big disappointment to everyone involved, I thought the line up for the London event was great and I was looking forward to attending the conference as much as I was looking forward to speaking at it.
If it’s any compensation you can see me do this talk at skill matter as one of their in the brain sessions:  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>After a few philosophical blog posts, I decided it was time for something a bit more concrete. I’ve been playing around a bit with F# and some web stuff recently using both RavenDB and PicoMvc so I thought I’d share with you how to create an autocomplete drop down using these technologies.
Creating an autocomplete in a HTML form is fairly common these days and there’s a nice jQuery plugin that takes care of the UI side of things.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>Like so many geeks I’m a massive XKCD fan. But I’m often troubled by questions like when will the 1000th XKCD appear, or the 1024th or even the 2000th? Even though the first two numbers are getting quite close now, it’s still more fingers and toes than I have so working it out by hand is out. Fortunately we have computers to this kind of heavy lifting for us, and the solution in F# is kinda cute.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>I think the term “Object Oriented” is somewhat over used these days, in fact I’d go so far as to say it’s been applied to such a wide variety of different languages that the term has become somewhat meaningless. Java and C# are object oriented languages and although these languages are fairly similar they are quite different from Javascript which also claims to be an object oriented language. Some might say that Javascript and Python are similar as they are both dynamically typed languages and they are both object oriented yet the way in which they are object oriented differs.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>Yesterday’s blog post contains a glaring error. Thanks to Eamon Nerbonne for point this out, his comments are very insightful so rather than reiterating them its best you read them for yourself. The basic problem was that the measurements of the speed of + - * operators was wrong since the compiler had spotted that the results of the operation was not used and therefore had not generated code for the loop.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>I recently read the “Disruptor: High performance alternative to bounded queues for exchanging data between concurrent threads” by the people at LMax. Some deeper thoughts on this are coming later. One interesting little tip-bit I learned is “On most processors there is a very high cost for the remainder calculation”, in other words calculating a modulus is slow. The paper goes on to say “This cost can be greatly reduced by making the ring size a power of 2.  … </p>
