			<div class="post-content">
				<p>I’ve been working quite a lot on the FunctionalNHibernate project recently. I’ve implemented the following features:
- Save records with native F# lists.
- Create one-to-many and many-to-many relations
- Generate identities automatically

We can now do just about everything you the FluentNHibernate first exampleproject does, although admittedly this is just a very small subset of what one can do with FluentNHibernateand NHibernate itself. 

In the future I’ll be looking at how to broadening what you can do with FunctionalNHibernate ClassMap descriptions and improve data access by integrating Linq like features.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>It’s already fairly well documented that F# doesn’t play too well with NHibernate and Fluent NHibernate, although you can make it play a littler nice with a bit of effort. However there are a few fundamental problems with this approach. The first is F# class’ are not really designed to be data containers because that’s what its record type is for. The second is that F# class’ do not put too much emphasis on virtual methods as in functional programming we tend to using pass functions as values as a way to achieve polymorphism rather than virtual methods.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>This morning there was an unexpected knock at the door and a courier arrived with a large package. I was quite surprised as hadn’t ordered anything. It turned out that it was my box of author copies of “Beginning F#”. So I’m happy to announce that “Beginning F#” is finally here and if you’ve pre-ordered it will be with you shortly.

“Beginning F#” is the updated version of “Foundation of F#”, it shares very much the same structure but I has been completely updated for the VS 2010 release of F#.  … </p>

				<p>The functional programming exchange in London last Monday (7th Dec) when off really smoothly. We had just over 50 people, mostly from the south east of England, but a few had travelled from places like Scotland, Brussels and Holland to see us. I’d like to say big thanks to all the speakers for providing interesting and thought provoking talks. So, thanks to Sadek, Matthew, Anton, Ganesh, and Duncan. Also, a big thanks to Skills Matter for providing the location, logistics, pizza and beer.  … </p>

				<p>UPDATE:The talk tonight (29 Oct) at Zenika has been postoned till November due to unforeseen circumstances. I'll let you know the exact date as soon as it is confirmed. My apologies for this.
 I’ll be doing a talk about functional programming in F# at Zenika, this Thursday, 29th October at 19h, as part of their community program. The talk will cover what functional programming is and how a language like F# is adapted to functional programming.  … </p>

				<p>I’m very happy to announce the “Functional Programming eXchange” which will take place in London at Skills Mater head quarters on the 7th December. I’ve been involved in organizing a program which will cover F#, Erlang, Scala and Haskell. The program has been designed to interested both people actively involved in functional programming in industry and working programmers with an interest in functional programming would like to learn more about how they can use these two techniques in their day job.  … </p>

				<p>Taking its name from twitter, with a large nod towards Roald Dahl's cautionary tale, the twits is a twitter app that lets you visualize you network of friends on twitter. It’s available to try here. Before we go any further you should know that this software is in alpha status, i.e. not for the fait hearted. Here’s an image of the results below.

				<p>So this blog has been quite lately, well it never was the most active in the world. Anyway the good news is there are lots of other good F# resources on the web at the moment. Particually Lang.NET was a great source of F# videos, I was there myself, but I’ve spoke with a few people who were, and indeed there they told me there was lots of interest in F#.  … </p>

				<p>Back in February this year I spoke at TechDays Paris 2009, I’ve always enjoyed TechDays Paris so a big thanks to Eric Mittelette and his team for inviting me to speak. Also, many thanks Julien Laugel who help me review the presentation slides and also shared some his experiences using F# with the audience. A screen cast of this presentation is now available. The slides for this presentation are available on the slideshare.  … </p>
