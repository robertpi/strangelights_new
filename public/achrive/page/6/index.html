			<div class="post-content">
				<p>A few people have accessed recently if they could have my slides from the “Combinators, DSLs, HTML and F#” talk I gave at functional programming exchange 2009. So I decided to add them to slide share.

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>I’ve finally got round to sorting out the code base to strangelights.com which was getting a big out of hand. Not much should have changed, but I’ve killed off lots of old files that weren’t being used and upgrade to the latest version of subtext. Now things are a little more under control, it should make it easier to update some of the out dated content, so hopefully you’ll see these changes over the next few weeks and months.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>At Progressive.NET one of the sessions I attended was Sebastien Lambla’stalk on OpenWrap. OpenWrap is a package management system for .NET projects. I’m excited about this project for a very simple reason: it’s something the .NET Open Source community desperately needs. 
What is package management?
Package manager is basically a piece of software that allows you to install the software or components you need on to your system. In one sense in the windows world this is handled by MSI, but that’s only half the picture of a package management system; ideally a package management system would provide a centralised server that handlers allowing to query what the latest version of a package is and download that or any other version of a package.  … </p>

				<p>I’ve been in London for the past few days. I arrived Tuesday afternoon and gave at talk at “The F#unctional Londoners Meetup Group”on the Tuesday evening. The talk was entitled “Using Language Oriented Programming to Execute Computations on the GPU” and thanks to the efficiency of the good folks at Skills Matter the talk is already available on line. The event was very well attended, with around 50 people turning up.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>In .NET strings are immutable. I think most .NET programmers agree that this is a good thing, as it generally makes code that works with strings safer and more predictable. However, operations that involve large amounts of string manipulation perform poorly because each time a string concatenation occurs then both strings must be copied. His often leads people to believe that all immutable objects will perform poorly. The aim of the article is to show that this is not the case, or at least it’s not as black and white as you may think.  … </p>

				<p>A few days ago Chris Wille, the man behind #Developcontacted me to say that #Develop had been accepted on the Google summer of codescheme. Essentially Google summer of code means that Google will pay CS students to spend their summer writing code for open source projects. Chris told me one area they are interested in extending is the F# integration into #Develop; particularly they’d like to get the auto-completion working.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>I’ll in London on the 10th/11th May giving a two day course entitle “Beginning F# Workshop”in conjunction with the lovely folks at Skills Matter. I think I give a fairly good description of the course on the workshop webpage, so I wanted to use this blog post to talk about why you would want to attend. I believe, as I stated in my book, that functional programming will be the next big wave in programming, and that F# will be one of the languages at the forefront of this functional programming renaissance.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>It was TechDays this week and I was lucky enough to be invited to speak with Don Syme and Adam Granicz. Don gave a short introduction to mailboxes/agent programming in F# and Adam gave an introduction to IntelliFactory’s WebSharper project.

My section of the talk was on using F# with Microsoft Accelerator. Accelerator is an interesting product, it allows you to take advance of the GPU of your PC. Even the most basic PCs have a specialized graphics chip and for most of the tasks you perform on your PC it just sits there doing nothing.  … </p>

				<p>I’m very happy to announce that FunctionalNHibernate has now been updated to work with the recently released Visual Studio 2010 release candidate. Also, it has now been setup to run on the codebetter build server. You can create a log on and download the latest binaries from here (you need an account but it’s very simple to create one).

A huge thanks to Steffen Forkmann, who did the work to get this set up.  … </p>
