			<div class="post-content">
				<p>F# does not get support C# style continuations yet; I am reliably informed that it will do at some point.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &ldquo;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&rdquo; /&gt;/o:p &nbsp;/o:p However if you can not wait that long it is already fair easy to get C# style continuations by implementing System.Collections.Generic.IEmunerable your self. What&#8217;s more this can be implemented as a library function then implementing your enumerator becomes just a couple of lines of code.  … </p>

				<p>Alois Kraus just made this nice post about functional programming in F# and C#. I enjoyed the article very much and he even bigs up one of my own posts, which of course tickled me.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &ldquo;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&rdquo; /&gt;/o:p &nbsp;/o:p However, I disagree with quite a lot of what he said in his conclusion paragraph. He writes:/o:p &nbsp;/o:p &#8220;Not all concepts of functional languages should be explored by Mort and Elvis since most of them are fairly complex to understand because functional languages are very picky (just like unix) who can be their friend and who not.  … </p>

				<p>Recently Don Syme made a post to the F# mailing list about some proposed changes to the F# libraries.

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>Rico made some more interesting posts in his parser performance quiz, first producing a parser where the predicates are compiled into an in memory representation and also a parser where he produces IL on the fly. He talks about them here and here respectively.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &ldquo;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&rdquo; /&gt;/o:p &nbsp;/o:p So I ported both of these parsers to F#; as they demonstrate some nice uses of patterns commonly used in ML, such as take one data structure that is easy to read and transforming it into another than is easy to evaluate.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>Last night I too another look at my parser and unfortunately discovered some quite serious flaws in the algorithm, it was just too lazy and almost always terminated before it should. To fix these I basically ended up starting from scratch, I&#8217;ve reloaded the results. I&#8217;ll be tidying it up and talking about what went wrong as part of a wider comparison of all 3 parsers.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &ldquo;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&rdquo; /&gt;/o:p </p>

				<p>Today was I was on holiday, doing a &#171;&nbsp;faire le ponte&nbsp;&#187; between the weekend and the public holiday toussaint (all saints day). I had chance to get lots of little jobs out of the way, such as tidying the garden and making the Christmas puddings. In between that I installed Visual Studio 2005 RTM on my laptop as apposed to a virtual machine.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &ldquo;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&rdquo; /&gt;/o:p &nbsp;/o:p So I thought I&#8217;d also take some time to write up some notes on things that I have noticed reflecting over generic types in framework version 2.  … </p>
