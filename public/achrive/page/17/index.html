				<p>&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &ldquo;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&rdquo; /&gt;&nbsp;/o:pI&#8217;ve recently moved into a new apartment in &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = &ldquo;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags&rdquo; /&gt;Copenhagen/st1:place/st1:City and it has no washing machine. This is why I was very pleased to find &#8220;The Laundromat Caf&#233;&#8221;, a bar with a small laundry at the back. I thought this was a really neat idea, certainly makes waiting of you&#8217;re clothes to dry a lot more pleasant.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>&nbsp; The Copenhagen Post is a news paper for English speakers living in &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = &ldquo;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags&rdquo; /&gt;Denmark/st1:place/st1:country-region. I tend to read it cover to cover because it&#8217;s very short and it&#8217;s weekly. It also gives me feeling of some local savvy. I spotted this interesting offer in the small ads sections. &nbsp;  &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &ldquo;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&rdquo; /&gt;&nbsp;/o:p Unfortunately I won&#8217;t be any where California/st1:place/st1:State in the near future so won&#8217;t be able to take him up on his offer (I&#8217;m assuming it is a bloke, but I bet I&#8217;m right).  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>The following two lines of code look innocent enough, but they create a problem that took us ages to track down. (Well not these exact lines of code but you get the idea). &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &ldquo;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&rdquo; /&gt;&nbsp;/o:p IPAddress address = IPAddress.Parse(&ldquo;&rdquo;);/o:p Console.WriteLine(address.ToString());/o:p &nbsp;/o:p The problem is on Windows XP (SP 1) this works fine, on Windows 2003 this code throws a FormatException. The reason is although you&#8217;re running exactly the same managed code the framework relies on unmanaged code to do most of the work, it p/invokes a method &#8220;inet_addr&#8221; in &#8220;ws2_32.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>I&#8217;ve just tried out creating a virtual directory with Wix and there&#8217;s really not that much too it, there&#8217;s a couple of places where the syntax isn&#8217;t that intuitive but the compiler nudges you in the right direction. I thought I&#8217;d share my experience anyway as the Wix post seem quite popular and it&#8217;s often nice to have a template to start from if you&#8217;re setting out to do these things.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>An msi is really a relational database made up of a number of tables. When an installation runs the windows installer parses the msi and then queries tables to see what actions it must perform. Msdn has a complete list of tables that the windows installer uses and it&#8217;s very worth while checking it out because it will give you a good idea of what you&#8217;re install is going to do and why.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>On the 10th September a new version of wix was released. This included two library files that would add the necessary elements to you&#8217;re wix file to drive the custom actions. This means creating a new user now works correctly. I&#8217;ve even tested adding the user to a group seems to work okay, although I am little cynical to whether this will work on a machine set up in a foreign language as the name of well know groups varies here.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>&nbsp; A couple of days ago I was reading a post about dynamic languages (scripting languages with good PR) on lambda the ultimate. The author wrote &#8220;&#8217;strong&#8217; typing is not the same as &#8216;explicit typing&#8217;&#8221;, which is very true and got me thinking about inferred type system, such as the one F# uses. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &ldquo;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&rdquo; /&gt;&nbsp;/o:p The big advantages is that doesn&#8217;t seem to be talked about much is that because in inferred type you don&#8217;t explicitly say what type an identifier is you get a lot more choice about what you compile it down to.  … </p>
