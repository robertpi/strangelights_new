			<div class="post-content">
				<p>As I alluded to in my earlier post I’ve wanted to find the time to write a longer post on developing Silverlight application. Using Silverlight is very straightforward and does actually require you to install anything other than F# and the Silverlight runtime. What out when installing the runtime, turn version are available confusingly name “1.0 beta” and “1.1 alpha”. It is the “1.1 alpha” version that you need as this the only one that includes the new version of the CLR, the dynamic language runtime or the “DLR” (not to be confused with the Docklands Light Rail).  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>I’m too tired to write a proper blog post about this but I managed to port DonSyme’s Game of Life Demo that comes with the F# Distribution to Silverlight. It’s not a full port as there were some UI events that I couldn’t get to work for love nor money – I think these maybe bugs in Silverlight itself. However the game does look pretty cool. Also Silverlight currently has no way to marshal back to the UI thread which makes multithreading a bit difficult.  … </p>

				<p>I know I've been very quite here lately. The reason for this is I've spend a lot of time working on _the book_. Anyway, all thats nearly over now, so hopefully I can get back to being a bit more chatty. Anyway, here is the announcement that I've made just a few moments ago on the hubfs.net that says its almost finished printing:

				<p>So apparently there’s an election for a new president in France at the moment. I don’t know how much appears in the media outside of France, but here you can read about little else. Well that’s not strictly true – but it seems to me no edition of my preferred newspaper, le Parisien (also probably the paper that one that requires the lowest level of French), is complete without at least 2 stories about the left’s presidential hopeful, Ségolène Royal, and one about the right’s Nicolas Sarkozy.  … </p>

				<p>You may have noticed that strangelights.com has a nice you look and feel. This was prompted by a major overhaul of the software I’m running. I upgraded from .text blogging software to subtext. While the difference between the two isn’t huge but I’m really pleased with the upgrade because they seem to have fixed virtually everything I didn’t like about .text. Also .text took nearly the whole day to setup and required me to hack the code base for to get it working with my former ISP, brinkster, whereas subtext only took about an hour to get going, including transferring all the data from .  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>I was playing around with implementing drawing a Mandelbrot set in F#. F# makes this very easy because of its Microsoft.FSharp.Math namespace provides a very easy to use complex implementation which means you just need to type out the equation and viola you have the Mandelbrot set. Or so I thought. My implementation end up being about 40 lines about 11 of which were the equation on which the Mandelbrot set was based and the rest of the code was infrastructure to use the equation and display the results.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>I&#8217;ve been playing with F# and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF a.k.a Avalon) and the combination is really nice. WPF comes with a new(ish) markup language called Xaml. This is another declarative language that works in a complimentary way to F#. Xaml allows you initialise an object graph into a specific state in a declarative style; moreover various designers will soon be come available to do this, so you won&#8217;t even have to hand code the Xaml file.  … </p>
