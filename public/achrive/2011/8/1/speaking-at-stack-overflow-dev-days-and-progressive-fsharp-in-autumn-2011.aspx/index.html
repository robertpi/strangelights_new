		<div class="post-content"><p>November is going to be a very busy month for me as I’m very happy to announce I’ll be speaking at <a href="http://devdays.stackoverflow.com/london/">Stack Overflow Dev Days at London’s ExCeL conference center on the 14th-15th November</a> and the <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/scala/progressive-f-tutorials">Progressive F# Tutorials at the Skills Matter eXchange on 3rd-4th November</a>.</p>  <p>Both events have a great line up of speakers (who wouldn’t be excited to speak on the same program as the legendary <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/22656/jon-skeet">Jon Skeet</a>?) and both will be lots of fun and very educational.</p>  <p>At Stack Overflow Dev Days I’ll be giving a 50 minute talk about combinators, one of my favorite functional programming topics. I hope to illustrate that combinators are a great approach for building Domain Specific Languages and while drawing some parallels with “Fluent” api that have become popular in OO languages recently.</p>  <p>At Progressive F# I’ll be using the longer 3 hour format to dig into building applications in F#. I hope to use this session to show that F# is a very particle language for every day programming tasks.</p>  <p>And if either of those events interests you, you may also be interested to know that I’m giving a 2 day tutorial, <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/course/scala/robert-pickerings-beginning-f-workshop">“Beginning F#” on 29th-30th September</a>. It’s a great way to get to grips with F# and see how you can start being more productive with this exciting language.    </p>
