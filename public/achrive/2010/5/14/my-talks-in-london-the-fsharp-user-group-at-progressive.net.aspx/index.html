<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">I’ve been in London for the past few days. I arrived Tuesday afternoon and gave at talk at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/FSharpLondon/">“The F#unctional Londoners Meetup Group”</a></font><font size="3"> on the Tuesday evening. The talk was entitled “Using Language Oriented Programming to Execute Computations on the GPU” and thanks to the efficiency of the good folks at Skills Matter the talk is <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/using-language-oriented-programming-to-execute-computations-on-the-gpu">already available on line</a></font><font size="3">. The event was very well attended, with around 50 people turning up. The talk covers more the Language Oriented Programming aspects than the knitty gritty details for detailing with the GPU and the audience seemed to enjoy it. It was a fun evening and good to meet Carolyn Miller, who started the group, as well fellow F# Guru’s <a href="http://www.ffconsultancy.com/">Jon Harrop</a></font><font size="3"> and <a href="http://www.trelford.com/blog/">Phil Trelford</a></font><font size="3">.<o:p /></font></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">I’ve also gave a talk at the Progressive.NET event organised by Skills Matter. This was a four hour tutorial, than covered the basics of the syntax, and how to use all the features. It then moved on to cover more advanced topics like language oriented programming, parallel programming and collective intelligence. The <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/beginning-f">video is already online</a></font><font size="3"> and there are a few pictures of me presenting on flickr:<o:p /></font></p>

<p>Yeah, the code from the the talk on GPU programming can be found here: <a rel="nofollow external" href="http://strangelights.com/blog/downloads/accelerator-quotations.zip" title="http://strangelights.com/blog/downloads/accelerator-quotations.zip">strangelights.com/&hellip;/accelerator-quotations.zip</a><br /><br />I&rsquo;ll be putting some of the examples from the tutorial up soon.</p>
